    WORD VECTOR estimation toolkit v 0.1c
    
    Options:
    Parameters for training:
    -train <file>
    Use text data from <file> to train the model
    -output <file>
    Use <file> to save the resulting word vectors / word clusters
    -size <int>
    Set size of word vectors; default is 100
    -window <int>
    Set max skip length between words; default is 5
    -sample <float>
    Set threshold for occurrence of words. Those that appear with higher frequency in the training data
    will be randomly down-sampled; default is 1e-3, useful range is (0, 1e-5)
    -hs <int>
    Use Hierarchical Softmax; default is 0 (not used)
    -negative <int>
    Number of negative examples; default is 5, common values are 3 - 10 (0 = not used)
    -threads <int>
    Use <int> threads (default 12)
    -iter <int>
    Run more training iterations (default 5)
    -min-count <int>
    his will discard words that appear less than <int> times; default is 5
    -alpha <float>
    Set the starting learning rate; default is 0.025 for skip-gram and 0.05 for CBOW
    -classes <int>
    Output word classes rather than word vectors; default number of classes is 0 (vectors are written)
    -debug <int>
    Set the debug mode (default = 2 = more info during training)
    -binary <int>
    Save the resulting vectors in binary moded; default is 0 (off)
    -save-vocab <file>
    the vocabulary will be saved to <file>
    -read-vocab <file>
    the vocabulary will be read from <file>, not constructed from the training data
    -cbow <int>
    Use the continuous bag of words model; default is 1 (use 0 for skip-gram model)
    
    Examples:
    ./word2vec -train data.txt -output vec.txt -size 200 -window 5 -sample 1e-4 -negative 5 -hs 0 -binary 0 -cbow 1 -iter 3
